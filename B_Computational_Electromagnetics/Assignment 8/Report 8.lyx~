\begin_layout Abstract
The waveform characteristics when the wave is made to propagate in an anisotropi
c medium is explore here.
 The axes arec hosen to be the principal axes, so that only the diagonal
 components are nonzero, and anisotropy in permittivity is only considered.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The update equations for constant epsilonx, epsilony and epsilonz have been
 constructed and invoked in both TE and TM case.
 A Yee cell has been chosen here, with the topleft corner containing 0 electric
 field, and bottom right corner portion having 0 magnetic field.
 The input is taken from two png file, one containing RGB information about
 the succeptibility in x,y and z tensor components and the orther containing
 the position of the source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simulation domain is 10 micrometer.
 750 pixels have been used left to right and hence the grid spacing has
 been chosen to be 10micrometer/750 = 13 nanometer.
 The Amplitude of the sinusoidal source is chosen to be 1 unit, in both
 TE and TM case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The epsilon matrix has been chosen such that epsilon x = 8, epsilony = epsilonz
 = 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Point source case
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the case of a point source placed at the center, for TM polatization,
 one can see that the equations do not get modified at all, as all equations
 with the epsilonx term becomes zero.
 Only dependance is there for epsilonz, which is chosen to be 1 anyway.
 Hence it can be expected that there is absolutely no difference between
 this case and the case with a point source in free space.
 The response obtained is as shown below:

\begin_layout Standard
For the TE case, the epsilonx conponent gets added in to the equation.
 the speed in the x direction should be expected to be 1/sqrt(2) times c.
 Hence with time, the output will resemble an oval, with it's major axis
 along the y axis and minot axis along x direction.
 the ratio of these lengths is sqrt(8).
 The response is as shown below:

\begin_layout Section
Line sources
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This case is not much different from the one above.
 When the source is kept vertically (along y),it's speed is supposed to
 be slower by a factor of sqrt(8),in the caseof TE.
 The response is shown below:

\begin_layout Standard
For the case of TM, it will be the same response as for the free space case:
 the light moves at the speed of light in vacuum.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
When the line source kept horizontally (along the x axis), the TE wave moves
 at the speed of light in vacuum, as epsilonx doesn't affect any of the
 equations.
 The wave is shown below:
